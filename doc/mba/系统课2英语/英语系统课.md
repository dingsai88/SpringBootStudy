But it’s not just a gender thing. At work, people pretty
much know what they’re supposed to be doing： working,
making money, doing the tasks they have to do in order to
draw an income. The bargain is very pure： Employee puts
in hours of physical or mental labor and employee draws
out life-sustaining moola. (15-1)
24.The word “moola”（Tine 4，Para 4）most probably

①This episode crystallizes the irony that although American men tend to talk more than women in public situations they often talk
less at home. ②And this pattern is wreaking havoc with marriage.
①The pattern was observed by political scientist Andrew Hacker in the late '70s. ②Sociologist Catherine Kohler Riessman reports in her new book "Divorce Talk" that most of the women she
interviewed -- but only a few of the men -- gave lack of communication as the reason for their divorces. ③Given the current divorce rate of nearly 50 percent that amounts to millions of cases in the United States every year -- a virtual epidemic of failed conversation.
[A] generating motivation. [B].exerting influence

What makes this slump different from the last, he says, is that
there are still buyers in the market, whereas in the early 1990s,
when interest rates were high, there was no demand even
though many collectors wanted to sell. Christie’s revenues in the
first half of 2009 were still higher than in the first half of 2006.
Almost everyone who was interviewed for this special report
said that the biggest problem at the moment is not a lack of
demand but a lack of good work to sell. The three Ds—death,
debt and divorce—still deliver works of art to the market. But
anyone who does not have to sell is keeping away, waiting for confidence to return.（10-1）
24.The three Ds mentioned in the last paragraph are ____
[A].auction houses ' favorites
[B].contemporary trends
[C].factors promoting artwork circulation
[D].styles representing impressionists

From career to community and family, these contrasts suggest that in the aftermath of
the searing Great Recession, those just starting out in life are defining priorities and

On the other hand, Tronick himself is concerned that the worries about kids‘ use of
screens are born out of an “oppressive ideology that demands that parents should always
be interacting” with their children: “It’s based on a somewhat fantasized, very white, very
upper-middle-class ideology that says if you’re failing to expose your child to 30,000
words you are neglecting them.” Tronick believes that just because a child isn’t learning
from the screen doesn’t mean there’s no value to it－particularly if it gives parents time to
have a shower, do housework or simply have a break from their child. Parents, he says,
can get a lot out of using their devices to speak to a friend or get some work out of the
way. This can make them feel happier, which lets then be more available to their child the
rest of the time（17-2）
29.The oppressive ideology mentioned by Tronick requires parents to_______.
A．protect kids from exposure to wild fantasies
B．teach their kids at least 30,000 words a year
C．ensure constant interaction with their children
D．remain concerned about kid's use of screens .

Across generational lines, Americans continue to prize many of the same traditional
milestones of a successful life, including getting married, having children, owning a home,
and retiring in their sixties. But while young and old mostly agree on what constitutes the
finish line of a fulfilling life, they offer strikingly different paths for reaching it.（16-4）
36. One cross-generation mark of a successful life is .

But when it came to their houses, it was a time of common sense and a belief that less
could truly be more. During the Depression and the war, Americans had learned to live
with less, and that restraint, in combination with the postwar confidence in the future,
made small, efficient housing positively stylish.（11-3）

There was an increase in involuntary part-time in June, but the general direction has

The “Case Study Houses” commissioned from talented modern architects by California
Arts & Architecture magazine between 1945 and 1962 were yet another homegrown
influence on the “less is more” trend. Aesthetic effect came from the landscape, new
materials and forthright detailing. In his Case Study House, Ralph Rapson may have
mispredicted just how the mechanical revolution would impact everyday life—few
American families acquired helicopters, though most eventually got clothes dryers—but
his belief that self-sufficiency was both desirable and inevitable was widely shared. （11-3）
35. What can we learn about the design of the “Case Study House”?
[A]Mechanical devices were widely used.

①What the study doesn’t measure is whether people are still doing work when they’re at
home, whether it is household work or work brought home from the office. ②For many
men, the end of the workday is a time to kick back. ③For women who say home, they
never get to leave the office. ④And for women who work outside the home, they often
are playing catch-up-with-household tasks. ⑤With the blurring of roles, and the fact that
the home front lags well behind the workplace in making adjustments for working women,
it’s not surprising that women are more stressed at home.
23.The blurring of working women’s roles refers to the fact that .

①No one tries harder than the jobless to find silver linings in this national economic
disaster.② Many said that unemployment, while extremely painful, had improved them in
some ways: they had become less materialistic and more financially prudent; they were
more aware of the struggles of others. ③In limited respects, perhaps the recession will
leave society better off. ④At the very least, it has awoken us from our national fever
dream of easy riches and bigger houses, and put a necessary end to an era of reckless
personal spending.

Even in traditional offices, “the lingua franca of corporate America has gotten much
more emotional and much more right-brained than it was 20 years ago, ”said Harvard
Business School professor Nancy Koehn. She started spinning off examples. “If you
and I parachuted back to Fortune 500 companies in 1990,we would see much less
frequent use of terms like journey, mission, passion. There were goals, there were
strategies, there were objectives, but we didn’t talk about energy; we didn’t talk about
passion.”（15-3）

Mies’s signature phrase means that less decoration, properly organized, has more
impact that a lot. Elegance, he believed, did not derive from abundance. Like other
modern architects, he employed metal, glass and laminated wood—materials that we
take for granted today but that in the 1940s symbolized the future. Mies’s
sophisticated presentation masked the fact that the spaces he designed were small
and efficient, rather than big and often empty. （11-3）

[A]was related to large space
[B]was identified with emptiness
[C]was not reliant on abundant decoration
[D]was not associated with efficiency

Germany thinks the euro must be saved by (stricter rules) on borrow spending and
competitiveness, backed by quasi-automatic sanctions for governments that do not
obey. These might include threats to freeze EU funds for poorer regions and EU
mega-projects and even the suspension of a country’s voting rights in EU ministerial
councils. It insists that economic co-ordination should involve all 27 members of the
EU club, among whom there is a small majority for free-market liberalism and
economic rigour; in the inner core alone, Germany fears, a small majority favour
French interference.（11-4）
38. To solve the euro problem ,Germany德国 proposed提议 that ______. .

[B] stricter regulations be imposed
[C] only core members be involved in economic co-ordination

These two academics use an array of behavioral research to show that the most
rewarding ways to spend money can be counterintuitive. Fantasies of great wealth
often involve visions of fancy cars and extravagant homes. Yet satisfaction with these
material purchases wears off fairly quickly what was once exciting and new becomes
old-hat; regret creeps in. It is far better to spend money on experiences, say Ms. Dunn
and Mr. Norton, like interesting trips, unique meals or even going to the cinema.
These purchases often become more valuable with time-as stories or memoriesparticularly if they involve feeling more connected to others.（14-1）
21. According to Dunn and Norton, which of the following is the most rewarding purchase?
[A]A big house
[B]A special tour ： special特殊的; 特别的; tour旅行
[C]A stylish car
[D]A rich meal

In order to make the most of our focus and energy. We also need to embrace
downtime, or as Newport suggests, "be lazy.”
“Idleness is not just a vacation, an indulgence or a vice; it is as indispensable to be
brain as Vitamin D is to the body...[idleness]is, paradoxically, necessary to getting any
work done, “he argues.(18-4)

Srini Pillay, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, believes
this counter-intuitive link between downtime and productivity may be due to the way
our brains operate. When our brains switch开关 between being focused and unfocused on
a task, they tend to be more efficient. (18-4)
39. Pillay believes that our brains’ shift转移 between being focused and unfocused _______.

As the industry advances, however, other suits may have an even greater impact.
Companies are unlikely to file many more patents for human DNA molecules—most
are already patented or in the public domain. Firms are now studying how genes

disease or predict a drug’s efficacy. Companies are eager to win patents for
“connecting the dots”, explains Hans Sauer, a lawyer for the BIO.（12-3）

However, Cortina said, early exposure is beneficial. When younger kids learn
computer science, they learn that it’s not just a confusing, endless string of letters and
numbers – but a tool to build apps, or create artwork, or test hypotheses. It’s not as
hard for them to transform their thought processes as it is for older students. Breaking
down problems into bite-sized chunks and using code to solve them becomes normal.
Giving more children this training could increase the number of people interested in
the field and help fill the jobs gap, Cortina said.(16-1)
21.Cortina holds that early exposure to computer science makes it easier to _______
[A]. complete future job training
[B]. remodel the way of thinking
[C]. formulate logical hypotheses
[D]. perfect artwork production

Competition law appears to be the only way to address these
imbalances of power．But it is clumsy. For one thing, it is very slow
compared to the pace of change within the digital economy. By the
time a problem has been addressed and remedied it may have vanished
in the marketplace, to be replaced by new abuses of power．But there
is a deeper conceptual problem, too. Competition law as presently
interpreted deals with financial disadvantage to consumers and this is
not obvious when the users of these services don’t pay for them．The
users of their services are not their customers．That would be the
people who buy advertising from them—and Facebook and Google，
the two virtual giants，dominate digital advertising to the disadvantage
of all other media and entertainment companies．（18-3）

[A]should serve the new market powers
[B]may worsen the economic imbalance

planning of such a fundamentally “grassroots”, concept as community sports
associations. If there is a role for government, it should really be getting involved in
providing common goods－making sure there is space for playing fields and the
money to pave tennis and netball courts, and encouraging the provision of all these
activities in schools. But successive governments have presided over selling green
spaces, squeezing money from local authorities and declining attention on sport in
education. Instead of wordy, worthy strategies, future governments need to do more
to provide the conditions for sport to thrive. Or at least not make them worse.（17-1）
24. With regard to mass sport, the author holds that governments should_____.
A．organize "grassroots" sports events
B．supervise local sports associations
C．increase funds for sports clubs
D．invest in public sports facilities  设施; 设备

关注：“should”“need”-主观情感或主观态度明确体现

On one hand, that viewpoint is a logical product of America’s evolution. Manufacturing
is not the economic engine that it once was. The job security that the US economy once
offered to high school graduates has largely evaporated. More education is the new
principle. We want more for our kids, and rightfully so.（18-1）
23. We can infer from Paragraph 5 that high school graduates .
[A]used to have more job opportunities
[B]used to have big financial concerns
[C]are entitled to more educational privileges
[D]are reluctant to work in manufacturing

While there’s a long way to go，the trend lines for renewables are spiking. The
pace of change in energy sources appears to be speeding up—perhaps just in time to
have a meaningful effect in slowing climate change. What Washington does—or

global shift in thought.
30. It can be inferred from the last paragraph that renewable energy .

[C]is not really encouraged by the US government

A new study suggests that contrary to most surveys，people are actually more
stressed at home than at work. Researchers measured people’s cortisol, which is a
stress marker, while they were at work and while they were at home and found it
higher at what is supposed to be a place of refuge.（15-1）
21.According to Paragraph 1，most previous surveys found that home .
[A]was an unrealistic place for relaxation
[B]generated more stress than the workplace
[C]was an ideal place for stress measurement
[D]offered greater relaxation than the workplace

“Further contradicting conventional wisdom, we found that women as well as men
have lower levels of stress at work than at home. “Write one of the researchers, Sarah
Damaske. In fact women even say they feel better at work, she notes, “It is men, not
women, who report being happier at home than at work.” Another surprise is that the
findings hold true for both those with children and without, but more so for
nonparents. This is why people who work outside the home have better health.（15-1）
22.According to Damaske，who are likely to be the happiest at home？
[A]Working mothers

Outside directors are supposed to serve as helpful, yet less biased, advisers on a firm’s
board. Having made their wealth and their reputations elsewhere, they presumably have
enough independence to disagree with the chief executive’s proposals. If the sky, and the

weathered their own crises.(11-1)

This slim volume is packed with tips to help wage slaves as well as
lottery winners get the most "happiness bang for your buck." It seems most
people would be better off if they could shorten their commutes to work,
spend more time with friends and family and less of it watching television
(something the average American spends a whopping two months a year
doing, and is hardly jollier for it).Buying gifts or giving to charity is often
more pleasurable than purchasing things for oneself, and luxuries are most
enjoyable when they are consumed sparingly. This is apparently the reason
MacDonald's restricts the availability of its popular McRib - a marketing
trick that has turned the pork sandwich into an object of obsession.

28.All of the following are true EXCEPT______ （10-2）
[A].men tend to talk more in public than women
[B].nearly 50percent of recent divorces are caused by failed conversation
[C].women attach much importance to communication between couples
[D].a female tends to be more talkative at home than her spouse





Para.2 This episode crystallizes the irony that although American men tend to
talk more than women in public situations they often talk less at home. And
this pattern is wreaking havoc with marriage.
Para.3 The pattern was observed by political scientist Andrew Hacker in the
late '70s. Sociologist Catherine Kohler Riessman reports in her new book
"Divorce Talk" that most of the women she interviewed—but only a few of the
men—gave lack of communication as the reason for their divorces. Given the
current divorce rate of nearly 50 percent, that amounts to millions of cases in
the United States every year—a virtual epidemic of failed conversation.
Para.4 In my own research complaints from women about their husbands
most often focused not on tangible inequities such as having given up the
chance for a career to accompany a husband to his or doing far more than
their share of daily life-support work like cleaning cooking social arrangements
and errands. Instead they focused on communication: "He doesn't listen to
me" "He doesn't talk to me." I found, as Hacker observed years before, that
most wives want their husbands to be, first and foremost, conversational
partners, but few husbands share this expectation of their wives.





Para.2 ...although American men tend to talk more than women in public situations
they often talk less at home. 
A和D 选项正确
Para.4 ... . Instead they focused on communication C项正确

Para.3 Given the current divorce rate of nearly 50 percent,... 目前美国离婚率为50%，

23.Which of the following statements is NOT true? （10-1）
[A].Sales of contemporary art fell dramatically from 2007to 2008.
[B].The art market surpassed many other industries in momentum.
[C].The market generally went downward in various ways.
[D].Some art dealers were awaiting better chances to come.


Para.2 ①The world art market had already been losing momentum for a while after
rising vertiginously since 2003. ②At its peak in 2007 it was worth some $65 billion,
reckons Clare McAndrew, founder of Arts Economics, a research firm—double the
figure five years earlier. ③Since then it may have come down to $50 billion. ④But the
market generates interest far beyond its size because it brings together great wealth,
enormous egos, greed, passion and controversy in a way matched by few other
industries.
Para.3 In the weeks and months that followed Mr. Hirst’s sale, spending of any sort
became deeply unfashionable, especially in New York, where the bail-out of the
banks coincided with the loss of thousands of jobs and the financial demise of many
art-buying investors. In the art world that meant collectors stayed away from galleries
and salerooms. Sales of contemporary art fell by two-thirds, and in the most
overheated sector—for Chinese contemporary art—they were down by nearly 90% in
the year to November 2008. Within weeks the world’s two biggest auction houses,
Sotheby’s and Christie’s, had to pay out nearly $200m in guarantees to clients who had
placed works for sale with them.






Para.5 ①What makes this slump different from the last, he says, is that there are still
buyers in the market, whereas in the early 1990s, when interest rates were high, there
was no demand even though many collectors wanted to sell. ②Christie’s revenues in
the first half of 2009 were still higher than in the first half of 2006. ③Almost everyone
who was interviewed for this special report said that the biggest problem at the
moment is not a lack of demand but a lack of good work to sell. ④The three Ds—
death, debt and divorce—still deliver works of art to the market. ⑤But anyone who
does not have to sell is keeping away, waiting for confidence to return.

Infants are wired to look at parents’ faces to try to understand their world, and if those
faces are blank and unresponsive—as they often are when absorbed in a device－it can
be extremely disconcerting foe the children. Radesky cites the “still face experiment”
devised by developmental psychologist Ed Tronick in the 1970s. In it, a mother is asked
to interact with her child in a normal way before putting on a blank expression and not
giving them any visual social feedback; The child becomes increasingly distressed as she
tries to capture her mother’s attention. “Parents don‘t have to be exquisitely parents at all
times, but there needs to be a balance and parents need to be responsive and sensitive
to a child’s verbal or nonverbal expressions of an emotional need,” says Radesky.（17-2）
28.Radesky’s cites the “still face experiment” to show that _______.
A．it is easy for children to get used to blank expressions

C．children are insensitive to changes in their parents’ mood
D．parents need to respond to children's emotional needs






①Infants are wired to look at parents’ faces to try to understand their world,
and if those faces are blank and unresponsive—as they often are when absorbed
in a device－it can be extremely disconcerting foe the children. ②Radesky cites
the “still face experiment” devised by developmental psychologist Ed Tronick in
the 1970s. ③In it, a mother is asked to interact with her child in a normal way
before putting on a blank expression and not giving them any visual social
feedback; The child becomes increasingly distressed as she tries to capture her
mother’s attention. ④"Parents don't have to be exquisitely parents at all times,
but there needs to be a balance and parents need to be responsive and sensitive
to a child’s verbal or nonverbal expressions of an emotional need," says Radesky.
注意：don’t have to…but… 辨证式句型
② ③表面例子的背景（devised by）和内容（In it…)，对应题干Radesky cites the“still
face experiment”； ④讲例子所要得到的结论或达到的目的（parents need to …),同义
转述： parents need to respond to children‘s emotional needs = parents need to be
responsive and sensitive to a child’s verbal or nonverbal expressions of an emotional
need（父母需对孩子情感上的语言和非语言表达作出回应并保持敏感）

Before explaining the connection to the Obamacare, it is worth
making an important distinction. Many people who work part-time
work actually want full-time jobs. They take part-time work
because this is all they can get. An increase in involuntary part-time
work is evidence of weakness in the labor market and it means that
many people will be having a very hard time making ends meet.
（15-4）
37.Many people work part-time because they_____.
[A] prefer part-time jobs to full-time jobs.
[B] feel that is enough to make ends meet.
[C] cannot get their hands on full-time jobs.
[D] haven’t seen the weakness of the market.

But the article is actually quite optimistic, as it outlines a
potential solution to this problem, suggesting that an approach
(which involves a one-hour, next-to-no-cost program) can close 63
percent of the achievement gap (measured by such factors as
grades) between first-generation and other students.（15-2）
27. The author of the research article are optimistic because .
[A]. the problem is solvable
[B]. their approach is costless
[C]. the recruiting rate has increased
[D]. their findings appeal to students

**解题思路—原因分析题**
**2. 原因分析题**
原文中没有出现任何表示“因果”的复现词，需要结合上下文理解分析隐含因果关系。

解题思路： 最难的题，去看细节题吧
 
根据“题干信号词”回原文定位，题干句是“果”，结合上下文，理解找
对应的“因”，即答案句。

只有两种情况：
1. “果” 居于 “因”的上文
2. “果” 居于 “因”的下文


Newspapers are becoming more balanced businesses, with a
healthier mix of revenues from readers and advertisers. American
papers have long been highly unusual in their reliance on ads. Fully
87% of their revenues came from advertising in 2008, according to
the Organization for Economic Cooperation & Development
(OECD). In Japan the proportion is 35%. Not surprisingly, Japanese
newspapers are much more stable. （11-2）
28. Compared with their American counterparts, Japanese
newspapers are much more stable because they ______. .
[A]have more sources of revenue
[B]have more balanced newsrooms
[C]are less dependent on advertising
[D]are less affected by readership



①Newspapers are becoming more balanced businesses, with a
healthier mix of revenues from readers and advertisers. ②American
papers have long been highly unusual in their reliance on ads. ③
Fully 87% of their revenues came from advertising in 2008,
according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation &
Development (OECD). ④In Japan the proportion is 35%. 

⑤Not surprisingly, Japanese newspapers are much more stable.
“not surprisingly, ...” “难怪，...” 逻辑上表示“结果”
逻辑结构分析：
原因： ② unusual in their reliance on ads. 对广告的过度依赖，是极不正常
的；
③给出具体数据作补充说明 ；
④接着说明日本的数据； 
⑤难怪，结论。
同义转述：美国不正常，因为对广告依赖过多
反之，日本稳定多了，因为对广告依赖少（= less dependent
on advertising ）



Today, widespread social pressure to immediately go to
college in conjunction with increasingly high expectations in a
fast-moving world often causes students to completely overlook
the possibility of taking a gap year. After all, if everyone you
know is going to college in the fall, it seems silly to stay back a
year, doesn‘t it? And after going to school for 12 years, it doesn’t
feel natural to spend a year doing something that isn’t academic.
（17-3）
31.One of the reasons for high-school graduates not taking a
gap year is that_____.
A．they think it academically misleading
B．they have a lot of fun to expect in college
C．it feels strange to do differently from others
D．it seems worthless to take off-campus course 


①Today, widespread social pressure to immediately go to
college in conjunction with increasingly high expectations in a fastmoving world often causes students to completely overlook the
possibility of taking a gap year. ②After all, if everyone you know is
going to college in the fall, it seems silly to stay back a year, doesn‘t
it? ③And after going to school for 12 years,. it doesn’t feel natural
to spend a year doing something that isn’t academic
“after all” 毕竟 对上文语义作补充解释，暗示② ③对①所述原
因（普遍的社会压力）的解释说明。
题干中：one of reasons 暗示原文会讲述多项原因。
同义转述：feels strange=silly（感觉傻）/not natural
to do differently from others（做与他人不一样的事）
=stay back a year（滞后一年）/to spend a year doing something
that isn’t academic（花一年时间做跟学习无关的事情）




It has not been much fun. Many papers stayed afloat by pushing
journalists overboard. The American Society of News Editors reckons that
13,500 newsroom jobs have gone since 2007. Readers are paying more for
slimmer products. Some papers even had the nerve to refuse delivery to
distant suburbs. Yet these desperate measures have proved the right ones
and, sadly for many journalists, they can be pushed further. (11-2)
27. Some newspapers refused delivery to distant suburbs probably because ______. [A]. readers threatened to pay less
[B]. newspapers wanted to reduce costs
[C]. journalists reported little about these areas
[D]. subscribers complained about slimmer products


①It has not been much fun. ②Many papers stayed afloat by
pushing journalists overboard.③ The American Society of News
Editors reckons that 13,500 newsroom jobs have gone since 2007.
④Readers are paying more for slimmer products. ⑤Some papers
even had the nerve to refuse delivery to distant suburbs. ⑥Yet
these desperate measures have proved the right ones and, sadly
for many journalists, they can be pushed further.
题干定位在⑤，着重看 ④ 和 ⑥。
④ ⑤ 都是报业的一种“减少成本”的措施，由⑥ these desperate
measures （这些孤注一掷的措施）得知。
