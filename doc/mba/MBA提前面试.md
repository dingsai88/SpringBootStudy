Since I entered my University, I have been studying hard.
 I was granted scholarship every semester. I have laid a solid foundation for
professional knowledge. Moreover, Ihave passed CET-4 and CET-6 with excellent scores,
and I am capable of reading English newspapers and magazines.

During the four years of my college life. I took part positively in various campus
activities, including XXXX,xxx and so on. You know...I attended some contests that were
closely relevant to my profession ,for example ____.All of those valuable
experiences enabled me to apply what I' ve learned to practice and made me realize my
weak point. So that' s the reason for my choice in further study.

Well about myself, you know.... I am open-minded, quick-learning and have strong
power on implement: I am fond of reading and in my spare time, I like reading many kind
of books, including history, novel and so on.
  
  Finally, that' s all for my self-introduction. I do believe that I can go further under the
guidance of the leaned professors here. Thank you again for giving me this opportunity!
